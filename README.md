# Debian-Pihole-Unbound
This repository is an attempt to show how Pihole and Unbound can be made to work on Debian (Bullseye).

## Why another tutorial about how to setup Pihole and Unbound

Well, despite the fact that there are many tutorials out there, none of them leads me from a freshly installed operating system to a functioning lokal domain name server. I had to crawl the web, collecting information and hints. Zhen I had to try if they work for me and most of them doesn't. Some of them were outdated, other simply wrong.

But I learned one thing: once there is a running system, make a backup. You installed und updated the OS? Make a backup. You installed Pi-hole? Make a backup. Unbound and Pi-hole work together? Make a backup. And after all the raspberry pi has been successfully integrated into your network? Make a backup and screenshots of your router configuration.
